i want to redesign the client creation **creating a new client** in an admin system with the following requirements:

---

### Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Page Title: "Add New Client"
- Form Fields:
    1. **Name** (text, required)
    2. **Username** (text, required, unique; will be used for client login)
    3. **Password** (password, required; allow alphabets, numbers, and symbols)
    4. **Mobile Number** (text, required; 10 digits validation)
    5. **Email ID** (email type, required)
    6. **Plan Selected** (dropdown: Silver - ₹510, Gold - ₹1010, Diamond - ₹1510)

- When the admin clicks **"Add Client"**:
    1. The form validates all inputs.
    2. If valid, the admin is redirected to a **Payment Page**.

---

### Payment Page
- Shows the **QR code/scanner** for payment.
- Displays the amount based on the selected plan.
- A "Payment Done" button (mock payment verification).
- Clicking "Payment Done" triggers a backend call to actually create the client.

---

### Backend (Node.js with Express + MongoDB or SQLite)
- **User Model Fields**:
    - `name` (string)
    - `username` (string, unique)
    - `password` (hashed)
    - `mobile` (string)
    - `email` (string)
    - `plan` (string: "Silver"|"Gold"|"Diamond")
    - `parentId` (string or null; refers to another client's `_id` for binary tree)
    - `children` (array of child client IDs, max length = 2)

- **Logic**:
    - When payment is confirmed:
        - Check that the username is unique.
        - Find the parent to attach the client under:
            - If admin adds directly, `parentId = adminId`.
            - If under another client, find the first available spot in their `children` array (max 2 children).
        - Insert the client into the database.
        - Update parent’s `children` array.
    - After successful creation, the new client should **immediately appear** in the **Manage Users panel**.

---

### Manage Users Panel
- A separate page: `manage-users.html`.
- Displays all registered clients in a table format.
- Columns: Name, Username, Email, Mobile, Plan, Parent Username.
- Data should update **dynamically** whenever a new client is added (AJAX refresh or page reload).
- Clicking a client row should open a **Client Details** page with full info.

---

### Validation
- Reject creation if:
    - Username already exists
    - Parent already has 2 children
    - Payment not confirmed

### Extra Notes
- Use **bcrypt** to hash passwords.
- Use session or temporary store to pass form data from "Add Client" page to "Payment" page before final creation.
- Include inline comments explaining:
    - Binary tree insertion logic
    - How new users appear in Manage Users panel
    - How data is fetched dynamically via AJAX
