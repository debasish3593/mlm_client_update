**Feature — Enhanced Manage Users Panel with Binary Tree View & Reports + Sidebar Fix + Add Client Parent ID Update**

### 1. **Manage Users Panel (Admin & Client Dashboard)**

Add a **Manage Users** section that contains **three tabs**:

**i) All Users Panel**

* Displays a searchable, filterable table of users.
* **Admin** sees **all users** in the system.
* **Client** sees **only their own downline**.

**ii) Binary Tree Panel**

* Displays **two separate binary tree visualizations**:

  **a. Full Community Tree** (Admin only) — Shows the entire hierarchy of all users in the system.
  **b. My Tree (Downline)** (Admin & Client) — Shows the logged-in user's own subtree (downline).

  **Binary Tree Rules & Features**:

  1. Each client node can have a maximum of **two children**.
  2. Clicking on a node opens a **details popup** showing:

     * Client's **name**, **username**, **plan**, **email**, **mobile number**.
     * **Parent link** (clickable to navigate upward).
     * **Children details**.
  3. Color-coded nodes for plan type:

     * **Silver** (₹510)
     * **Gold** (₹1010)
     * **Diamond** (₹1510)

**iii) Report User Panel**

* Displays reports for the user network:

  * Plan distribution
  * Referral counts
  * Earnings

### 2. **Access Control**

* **Admin**: Can view **All Users**, **Full Community Tree**, and **Report User** panel.
* **Client**: Can view **All Users** (their downline), **My Tree**, and **Report User** (only their own network).

### 3. **Tree Display Requirements**

* Trees must be **responsive** with horizontal scrolling for large networks.
* Expand/Collapse functionality for branches.
* Smooth zoom and drag support for navigation.

### 4. **Sidebar Scrolling Fix**

* **Issue**: When panels expand, the sidebar hides bottom menu items, and scrolling down is not working.
* **Fix**: Make the sidebar **vertically scrollable** so that all menu items remain accessible, even when the viewport is small or content expands.

### 5. **Add New Client Panel Update**

* **Issue**: The current "Add New Client" form does not include a **Parent ID** input to link the new client to their sponsor/upline.

* **Update**:

  * Add a **Parent ID** field (hidden or visible) that records the user who created the client.
  * For now, **only the admin** will be able to create new clients.
  * Later, allow **any existing user** to create clients under their own downline.

* **Functionality**:

  * When creating a client, check if the `parentId` already has **two children**. If yes, reject creation and show an error.
  * Link the new client to the parent's `children` array.
